# Pressure Vessel Total Cost Optimisation in Octave
Implementing optimisation algorithms from scratch to solve the pressure vessel optimisation problem in Octave.

## Course Info
Name: Numerical Optimisation

Code: WQD7011

Repo type: Group Project

## Project Structure
1. `src`: Containing general use functions
2. `examples`: Executable examples for the optimisation problem

## How to use this repository
1. Install and launch Octave
2. Install `symbolic` package from Octave
3. Open this project in Octave
4. Go to `./examples/sdm_sphere_benchmark.m` to run the simplest Sphere benchmark with one variable (MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING FROM EXAMPLES DIRECTORY)

## For WQD7011 group project purposes
1. Go to `examples` folder.
2. Run `sdm_pressure_vessel.m` for using steepest descent algorithm to solve the pressure vessel optimisation problem.
3. Run `qnewton_sr1_pressure_vessel.m` for using Quasi-Newton with SR1 algorithm to solve the pressure vessel optimisation problem.
4. Run `qnewton_bfgs_pressure_vessel.m` for using Quasi-Newton with BFGS algorithm to solve the pressure vessel optimisation problem.
5. Compare the results.
